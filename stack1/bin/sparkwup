# --restart
#   always restart it if dies (mostly for machine restarts)
# --net
#   netup creates vm-bridge; it's what it sounds like
# --hostname
#   give the Linux inside the container a hostname (it shows up in various web pages)
# -p
#   8081 is the Web UI port; conflicted with ZooKeeper admin, but mapped that one
#      because the master web interface uses the default for drill-down and I have no idea how to change that
# -v
#   conf/sparkw is not yet used
#   sparkw is where job data is written (and logs is a subdirectory); must be in root group.
# -e
#   SPARK_LOCAL_HOSTNAME used to chat with other Spark things; must match hostname
#   SPARK_IDENT_STRING no idea; instructions say to set it
#   SPARK_PUBLIC_DNS override the Docker network so outside-container stuff can see it
